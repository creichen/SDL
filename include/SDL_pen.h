/**
 *  \file SDL_pen.h
 *
 *  Include file for SDL pen event handling.
 *
 *  This file describes operations for pressure-sensitive pen (stylus and/or eraser) handling, e.g., for input
 *    and drawing tablets or suitably equipped mobile / tablet devices.
 *
 *  To get started with pens:
 *  - Listen to ::SDL_PenMotionEvent and ::SDL_PenButtonEvent
 *  - To avoid treating pen events as mouse events, ignore  ::SDL_MouseMotionEvent and ::SDL_MouseButtonEvent
 *    whenever "which" == ::SDL_PEN_MOUSEID.
 *
 *  This header file describes advanced functionality that can be useful for managing user configuration
 *    and understanding the capabilities of the attached pens.
 *
 *  We primarily identify pens by ::SDL_PenID.  The implementation makes a best effort to relate each :SDL_PenID
 *    to the same physical device during a session.  Formerly valid ::SDL_PenID values remain valid
 *    even if a device disappears.
 *
 *  For identifying pens across sessions, the API provides the type ::SDL_GUID .
